# Clio
 Clio is the first web application I built using an AngularJS framework (1.x). It is a web application designed to make the history classroom dynamic. It allows classes to collaboratively build timelines, maps and engage in disucssions that construct their learning exprience.

## How it Works
 Intructors create an account and then construct a basic template for their. They can then invite students to join the site. Together, instructors and students can then build timelines, interactive maps, and share inforamtion and enage in conversation in a discussion forum. Clio is designed to be used as a tool that can supplement other class work or serve as a course on its own. For more, visit the site prototype at http://clio-app.herokuapp.com

## Framework
 Clio iuses AngularJS (1.x) as a front end framework, node.js/Sails.js as its server-side framework and MongoDB for data storage.

## JavaScript Libraries and NPM Modules used
 Mapbox, Leaflet.js, Timeline.js, Moment.js, Bcrypt, Geocoder
