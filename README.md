# Clio
 Clio is the first web application I built using an AngularJS framework. Working largely on my own, it took me nine days to complete the initial prototype. It is a web application designed to make the history classroom dynamic. It allows classes to collaboratively build timelines, maps and engage in disucssions that construct their learning exprience.

## How it Works
 Intructors create an account and then construct a basic template for their. They can then invite students to join the site. Together, instructors and students can then build timelines, interactive maps, and share inforamtion and enage in conversation in a discussion forum. Clio is designed to be used as a tool that can supplement other class work or serve as a course on its own.

## Framework
 Clio is an MVC app that uses AngularJS as its front end framework, Node/Sails.js as its server-side framework

## Models
 Clio uses MongoDB as its database, and includes 8 models, storing infomration about users (instructors), students, maps, maps locations, timelines, timeline events, and class discussions.

## APIs, JavaScript Libraries, and NPM Modules used
 Mapbox, Leaflet.js, Timeline.js, Moment.js, Bcrypt, Geocoder
